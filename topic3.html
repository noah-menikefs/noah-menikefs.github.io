        	<p> In modern society, computers are apart of our everyday lives and computer networks are at the core of modern communication. These computer networks are a collection of computers and hardware components interconnected by communication channels that allow the sharing of resources and information. Two such devices can be said to be networked together when one device is able to exchange information with the other device, whether or not they have a direct connection to each other. Without these, device sharing would be impossible. Computer networks support an enormous number of applications and services. The most common resource shared today is the connection to the <b> Internet</b>. In fact, the Internet itself can be considered a computer network. Other shared resources can include a printer or a file server. These devices which are on a network are referred to as nodes. Nodes can be connected via cabling, most commonly the Ethernet cable, or can be done wirelessly, through radio waves. Connected computers can share resources, like access to the Internet, printers, file servers, etc. A network is a multipurpose connection, which allows a single computer to do more. There are many different types of networks and networks are commonly categorized based on their characteristics. Some types of networks include <b> LAN, WAN, VLAN, SAN, WLAN, Intranet, Extranet, VPN, PAN, P2P</b>. Computer networks can be broken down historically into topologies, which is a technique of connecting computers. A network topology is the arrangement of a network, including its nodes and connecting lines. There are two ways of defining network geometry: the physical topology and the signal topology. The most common topology today is a collapsed ring. This is due to the success of a network protocol called the Ethernet. This protocol, or network language, supports the Internet, Local Area Networks, and Wide Area Networks, which will all be described further into detail later in this topic exploration.</p>

  <p>
  	The internet is a globally <b>inter</b>connected <b>net</b>work system that uses the Transmission Control/Internet (TCP/IP) protocols to transmit data through various types of media. TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. These internet protocols provide a set of rules and procedures. TCP defines how applications can create channels of communication across a network. Whereas, IP defines how to address and route each data file to ensure it reaches the correct destinations. As you may know, each computer has their own unique IP address. Moreover, the internet is a network of global exchanges which includes private, public, business, academic and government networks which are all connected by wired, wireless and fibre-optic technologies. The internet is an example of a Wide Area Network, which I will explain further into detail shortly after.

LAN stands for <b>L</b>ocal <b>A</b>rea <b>N</b>etwork. As the name suggests, these networks cover local areas. By definition, they are computer networks that interconnect computers within a limited area. Often, a LAN is confined to a single room, building or group of buildings; however, one LAN can be connected to other LANs over any distance via telephone lines and radio waves. Typically, a LAN will be found in areas such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building. Whether wired or wireless, nearly all modern LANs are
based on Ethernet, a set of protocols for exchanging data. The two ways to implement Ethernet are Ethernet cables, which were mentioned earlier, or wirelessly (Wi-Fi radio waves).

  <p>WAN stands for <b>W</b>ide <b>A</b>rea <b>N</b>etwork. The WAN is similar to the LAN but it covers an area wider than a LAN. The broad distances can range from a network connecting multiple buildings on a corporate or college campus to satellite links connecting offices in different countries. Often, WANs contain a collection of much smaller LANs. The largest WAN is the internet, as mentioned previously. In fact, it is a collection of other networks, including other LANs and WANs. Finally, WANs can be wired (using fibre-optic cable) or wireless (using microwave or satellite transmission technology).

<div class="VLAN text">
  <p>A <b>V</b>irtual <b>L</b>ocal <b>A</b>rea <b>N</b>etwork (VLAN) is a group of workstations, servers and network devices that appear to be on the same LAN despite their geographical distribution. A VLAN allows a network of computers and users to communicate in a simulated environment as if they exist in a single LAN. VLANs are implemented to achieve security and ease of network management and can quickly adapt to changes in network requirements and relocation of workstations. Another benefit they can possess is the removal of latency (delay) in the network, which saves network resources and increases network efficiency. Security is improved with VLANs because they network administrators to apply additional security to network communication. However, they have a high risk of virus issues because one infected system may spread a virus through the whole logical network.

<div class="SAN text">
  <p>A <b>S</b>torage <b>A</b>rea <b>N</b>etwork (SAN) is a secure data network that provides access to block-level storage. Block storage is virtual data storage typically used in environments where data is stored in volumes, also referred to as blocks. Each block is assigned an arbitrary identifier by which it can be stored and retrieved. Each block acts as an individual hard drive and is configured by the storage administrator. A SAN makes a network of storage devices accessible to multiple servers. SANs are typically composed of hosts, switches, storage elements, and storage devices that are interconnected using a variety of technologies. SAN nodes appear to servers as attached drives, unlike traditional network bottlenecks. A few benefits to the use of SANs include improved application availability with multiple data paths, enhanced application performance, increased storage utilization and effectiveness, and improved data protection and security.

<div class="WLAN text">
  <p>A <b>W</b>ireless <b>L</b>ocal <b>A</b>rea <b>N</b>etwork (WLAN) is a wireless computer network that links two or more devices using wireless communication to form a LAN. A WLAN allows users to move around the coverage area, often a home or small office, while maintaining a network connection. Unlike a traditional wired LAN, in which devices communicate over Ethernet cables, devices on a WLAN communicate via radio waves. In a WLAN, data is transmitted over the air using one of the Wi-Fi protocols instead of traditional cables. As wireless devices have grown in popularity, so have WLANs. In fact, most routers sold are now wireless routers. A wireless router serves as a base station, providing wireless connections to any Wi-Fi-enabled devices within range of the router's wireless signal. This includes laptops, tablets, smartphones, and other wireless devices, such as smart appliances and smart home controllers. The most obvious advantage of a WLAN is that devices can connect wirelessly, eliminating the need for cables. However, a disadvantage is that wireless networks are naturally less secure than wired networks. Any wireless device can attempt to connect to a WLAN.

<div class="VPN text">
  <p>A <b>V</b>irtual <b>P</b>rivate <b>N</b>etwork uses the internet to allow people to log into a network remotely and access its resources but encrypts the connection to prevent eavesdroppers. This means the network does not have to be located in one physical location like a LAN. However, by using encryption and other security measures, a VPN can scramble all the data sent through the wide area network, so the network is "virtually" private. If your company sets you up with a VPN, you can access your corporate intranet, file servers or email from home or a coffee shop, as though you were using it in your office. (Refer to Nikhil’s Website for 3.1.4 Identify the technologies required to provide a VPN and 3.1.5	Evaluate the use of a VPN. I will provide a link on my page to his.)

  <p>PAN stands for <b>P</b>ersonal <b>A</b>rea <b>N</b>etwork. Similar to LANs, they are networks covering a very small area, usually a small room. The best known wireless PAN network technology is Bluetooth, and the most popular wired PAN is USB. You might not think of your wireless headset, your printer or your smartphones as components in a network, but they communicate through PANs. Since PANs are designed to be limited to a single user, they are often secured automatically by only accepting connections from authorized devices.

  <p><b>P</b>eer-<b>to</b>-<b>P</b>eer (P2P) is a network model in which computers or hardware devices exchange files. Some experts describe it as an “equal client” system where instead of accessing files from a server, the “peer” computers just swap them amongst each other. The only requirements for a computer to join a peer-to-peer network are an Internet connection and P2P software.

  <p>An extranet is a controlled private network allowing customers, partners, vendors, suppliers and other businesses to gain information, typically about a specific company or educational institution, and do so without granting access to the organization's entire network. They are often private sectors of websites. It is restricted to select users through user IDs, passwords and other authentication mechanisms on a login page.

  <p>An intranet is a network where employees can create content, communicate, collaborate, get stuff done, and develop the company culture. Much like an extranet, an intranet is a private, secured network designed to facilitate collaboration and make it easier to communicate and share documents in real time. The major difference between the two; however, is that an intranet is typically used internally. While an extranet allows businesses to communicate with clients and vendors, an intranet allows employees and colleagues to work with each other in a virtual space with no outside parties involved.
