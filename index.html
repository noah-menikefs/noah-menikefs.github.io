<div class="jumbotron">
  <p>
  <b>1.2.1</b> Define the terms: Hardware, software, peripheral, network, human resources. </p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p> <b>1.2.2</b> Describe the roles computers can take in a networked world.
</div>

<div class="Hardware">
  <h2>Hardware</h2>
  <p>Hardware refers to the physical parts used in a computer. Hardware, as opposed to software, is termed because it is "hard" or rigid with respect to changes or modifications. Some examples of important hardware are: Central processing unit, monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, graphic card, sound card, speakers and motherboard.</p>
  <h4>Internal Hardware vs External Hardware</h4>
  <p> Inernal hardware includes pieces that are located on the the inside of a computer's architecture. They are often referred to as the components of a computer and include parts such as motherboards, hard drives and RAM. External hardware is located outside of the computer's interior. We will discuss this concept futher in the peripheral section.</p>
</div>

<div class="Software">
  <h2>Software</h2>
  <p>Software refers to the various programs that enable a computer to perform specific tasks. It consists of lines of code written by computer programmers that have been compiled into a computer program. In the computer the programs are stored as binary. Software is often divided into application software (programs that do work users are directly interested in) and system software (which includes operating systems and any program that supports application software).</p>
</div>

<div class="Peripheral">
  <h2>Peripheral</h2>
  <p>A computer peripheral is a device that is connected to a computer but is not part of the core computer build. There are many different peripheral devices, but they fall into three general categories:</p>
  <h4>Input Devices</h4>
  <p>Input devices have the role of sending data to a computer. They allow users to communicate and give instructions for processing, display or storage. A mouse or keyboard are examples of input peripherals.</p>
  <h4>Output Devices</h4>
  <p>An output device is any device that is used for sending data to the user or another computer. Monitors and printers are examples of output peripherals.</p>
  <h4>Storage Devices</h4>
  <p>A storage device is any hardware which is capable of holding data externally. This includes memory cards or USBs.
</div>

<div class="Network">
  <h2>Network</h2>
  <p>A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources, exchange files, or allow electronic communications. It can be as small as two computers or as large as billions of devices. Many types of networks exist, but they fall under two primary categories: LANs and WANs. I will explore this topics further in my topic 3 exploration.</p>
</div>

<div class="HR">
  <h2>Human Resources</h2>
  <p>Human resources refers to the people who are part of a company responsible for managing employees. These are the end-users of a created system.</p>
</div>

<div class="Roles">
  <h2>Computer Roles in a Networked World</h2>
  <p>Depending on the software implemented in a computer, it can achieve various tasks. These roles can be classified as clients, servers, routers and firewalls</p>
</div>

<div class="Clients">
  <h2>Clients</h2>
  <p>A server is a computer that provides data for other computers. Depending on the server (web, mail, file, etc.) each type runs a different software for their specific purpose. Although server software is specific to the type of server, the hardware is not as important.</p>
</div>

<div class="Routers">
  <h2>Routers</h2>
  <p>Routers allow us to route data from a local network to another network. It can be found as a hardware device or a software built into a computer.</p>
</div>

<div class="Firewall">
  <h2>Firewall</h2>
  <p>A firewall acts as protection for a trusted network from outside connections. It acts as a filter which allows trusted data to pass through.</p>
